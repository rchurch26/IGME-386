    /// A multipart linear shape.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Polyline geometries represent the shape and location of linear features, such as a street
    /// in a road network, a contour line representing an elevation value, or a hiking trail. A
    /// polyline can be used to define geometry for features and graphics, or as input or output
    /// for tasks or geoprocessing operations, such as the output of a network trace.
    /// 
    /// A polyline can be used as the geometry of a <see cref="">Feature</see> or <see cref="">Graphic</see>. To obtain the
    /// geometry on these objects, use <see cref="">GeoElement.geometry</see>.
    /// 
    /// A polyline is composed of a series of connected segments, where each <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISSegment">ArcGISSegment</see> defines a
    /// continuous line between a start and an end point. You can define a new polyline from a
    /// collection of <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPoint">ArcGISPoint</see> objects to create a series of straight <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISLineSegment">ArcGISLineSegment</see> objects
    /// connecting the points you specified. You can use <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolylineBuilder">ArcGISPolylineBuilder</see> to build a polyline
    /// one point at a time, or to modify an existing polyline.
    /// 
    /// A polyline can have multiple parts. Each part is a series of connected segments, but the
    /// parts can be disjoint, for example, a polyline representing a street that ends, and starts
    /// again a block later. Parts can also intersect at one or more points (or vertices), for
    /// example, a polyline representing a river and its tributaries.
    /// 
    /// Polylines inherit from <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISMultipart">ArcGISMultipart</see>, which provides members for iterating the segments and
    /// points of each part in a polyline.
    /// 
    /// Polylines are based upon the parent <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry">ArcGISGeometry</see> class which is immutable, meaning you can
    /// not change its shape once it is created. If you need to modify a polyline once it has been
    /// created, use the <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolylineBuilder">ArcGISPolylineBuilder</see> class.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <seealso cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry">ArcGISGeometry</seealso>
