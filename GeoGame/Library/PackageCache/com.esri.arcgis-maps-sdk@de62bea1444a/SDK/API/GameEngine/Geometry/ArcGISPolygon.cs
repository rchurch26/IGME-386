    /// <remarks>
    /// Polygon geometries represent the shape and location of areas, for example, a country, island,
    /// or a lake. A polygon can be used as the geometry of features and graphics, or as input or
    /// output of tasks or geoprocessing operations, such as the output of a drive-time analysis or a
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryEngine.Buffer">ArcGISGeometryEngine.Buffer</see> operation.
    /// 
    /// Each part of a multipart polygon is a series of connected <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISSegment">ArcGISSegment</see> objects forming a
    /// closed ring. Each part must not cross any other part, but may lie completely inside or
    /// outside another part. For example, a polygon representing the state of Hawaii would comprise
    /// eight disjoint parts, one representing each island. A polygon representing the country of
    /// South Africa, which completely surrounds the enclave of Lesotho, would comprise two parts,
    /// one contained inside the other.
    /// 
    /// Like polyline, the polygon class is a <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISMultipart">ArcGISMultipart</see>, which provides members for iterating the
    /// segments and points of each part in a polygon. Unlike parts in a polyline, however, each
    /// part of a polygon defines a closed area, so the end point of the last segment in the part is
    /// always in the same location as the start point of the first segment, forming a closed
    /// boundary. 
    /// 
    /// When defining a polygon part, there is no need to explicitly close it by repeating the start
    /// point as the last point. Polygons parts are always interpreted as enclosed areas by ArcGIS
    /// Runtime. 
    ///         
    /// Interior rings to make donut polygons should be counter-clockwise in direction to have the
    /// correct topology.
    /// 
    /// If there is ever a doubt about the topological correctness of a polygon, call the 
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryEngine.Simplify">ArcGISGeometryEngine.Simplify</see> method to correct any issues. This is especially true
    /// if you pass a polygon to ArcGIS Server for a geoprocessing task to avoid any ArcGIS Server
    /// errors being thrown or to rectify polygons that may be self-intersecting, have rings which
    /// are partially contained in each other, or contain incorrect ring orientations.
    /// 
    /// Polygons are based upon the parent <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry">ArcGISGeometry</see> class. The geometry object is
    /// immutable which means that you can not change its shape once it is created. If you need to
    /// create a new polygon or modify it once it has been created, use the <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolygonBuilder">ArcGISPolygonBuilder</see> class.
    /// 
    /// A polygon can be used as the geometry of a <see cref="">Feature</see> or <see cref="">Graphic</see>. To obtain the
    /// geometry on these objects, use <see cref="">GeoElement.geometry</see>.
