    /// <remarks>
    /// This status is used to determine whether a elevation source is displaying in the View or whether it is still loading,
    /// not enabled, out of scale, or has encountered an error or warning. Each elevation source can have multiple status at the 
    /// same time. For example, a elevation source could be both <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled</see> and <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.OutOfScale">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.OutOfScale</see>, 
    /// or it could be <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled</see> and <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Loading">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Loading</see>. These multiple status are 
    /// represented using a flag enumeration.
    /// 
    /// A status of <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Active">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Active</see> indicates that the elevation source is being displayed in the view. Note, that some 
    /// of the elevation source view status are not possible together. For example, a elevation source cannot be both 
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Active">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Active</see> and <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.NotEnabled</see> at the same time. 
    /// 
    /// If you implement a elevation source list in a table of contents (TOCs), you can use the elevation source view status to manage the TOC 
    /// user interface. For example, you could gray out the elevation source if it is <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.OutOfScale">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.OutOfScale</see>, or you could 
    /// show a spinning icon if the elevation source is <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Loading">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Loading</see>.
    /// 
    /// If the elevation source completely fails to load or render you will encounter a <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Error">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Error</see>. If the elevation source 
    /// fails to render some of its content then you will encounter a <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Warning">ArcGISElevationSourceViewStatus.Warning</see>. This could be due to
