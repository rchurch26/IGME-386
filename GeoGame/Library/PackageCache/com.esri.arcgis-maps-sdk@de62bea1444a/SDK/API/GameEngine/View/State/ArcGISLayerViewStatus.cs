    /// This status is used to determine whether a layer is displaying in a <see cref="GameEngine.View.ArcGISView">ArcGISView</see> or whether it is still loading,
    /// not visible, out of scale, or has encountered an error or warning. Each layer can have multiple status at the 
    /// same time. For example, a layer could be both <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.NotVisible">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.NotVisible</see> and <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.OutOfScale">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.OutOfScale</see>, 
    /// or it could be <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.NotVisible">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.NotVisible</see> and <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Loading">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Loading</see>. These multiple status are 
    /// represented using a flag enumeration.
    /// 
    /// A status of <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Active">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Active</see> indicates that the layer is being displayed in the view. Note, that some 
    /// of the layer view status are not possible together. For example, a layer cannot be both

    /// If you implement a layer list in a table of contents (TOCs), you can use the layer view status to manage the TOC 
    /// user interface. For example, you could gray out the layer if it is <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.OutOfScale">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.OutOfScale</see>, or you could 
    /// show a spinning icon if the layer is <see cref="GameEngine.View.State.ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Loading">ArcGISLayerViewStatus.Loading</see>.
